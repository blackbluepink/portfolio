        <h1>From Colonial Shadows to the Enlightenment of My Heritage</h1>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Paulo Coelho. These are the authors I remember reading in high school in Pakistan. You know what I wouldn’t be able to tell you? A single Pakistani author. Not one. And that’s true even though our country boasts amazing writers like Ahmed Ali, Mohsin Hamid, Kamila Shamsie, and Intizar Hussain. This absence, I think, tells us a lot about the lingering effects of colonialism on our education system and the way language and literature are weaponized against our people. <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Pakistan, the effects of British colonialism are especially clear in the literature I was introduced to, dominated by white British authors. Not only was speaking proper English seen as a mark of intelligence and superiority, speaking English with a British accent was somehow more prestigious. In many ways, English became a sort of cultural and social capital that I, like many others, felt we had to acquire in order to succeed. This idea was reinforced by the rules in my school, where speaking English wasn’t just encouraged but required. Students who spoke Urdu, Pakistan’s national language, using words like “abay” and “baway” (slang words which mean bro) were often looked down on, as if their choice of language somehow made them less capable or sophisticated. In trying to conform to these white-colonizer standards and gain acceptance, I ended up losing my own voice. The rich stories of my heritage, my ancestors, and my Pakistani culture, from the folktales of Heer Ranjha and Sassi Punnu to the profound works of poets like Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Allama Iqbal, were overshadowed by this need to conform to an external standard of excellence. <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is especially tragic when you consider all the amazing Pakistani books which, had I been introduced to at a young age, could have profoundly shaped my sense of identity and given me an alternative to the British-centric narratives I was taught. One such example is Twilight in Delhi by Ahmed Ali. The novel is about the gradual decline of an ancient city, both culturally and socially, under British colonial rule. Ahmed Ali shows Pakistani culture and identity being replaced by foreign norms and illustrates how those who resist this foreign influence are marginalized and looked down upon, highlighting the tension between tradition and the standards of modernity imposed by colonial powers. I think reading books like this would have been a reminder that our history and stories are just as significant as those we were taught to look up to. Maybe through reading Pakistani authors like Ahmed Ali, I could have realized earlier that my self-worth and intelligence didn’t depend on how well I could mimic a Western ideal but instead on my ability to raise a new voice in the world. <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, when I moved to America for college at Howard, a historically-Black institution, my understanding of identity and language began to shift in ways I hadn't anticipated. For instance, reading Carmen Kynard’s "Stank 2.0" at first felt alien as it discussed the linguistic conventions of the Black community, but eventually, I started discovering similar patterns of colonial prejudice that affected both the Black and Pakistani communities. Kynard’s assertion that “You do not give up who you are to be an academic writer; on the contrary, you take who you are even MORE seriously” became a source of inspiration as it was a reminder that I didn’t need to abandon my cultural roots to succeed in an academic environment. Instead, I could incorporate my identity in my work, including cultural references like qawwali and traditional poetry and reflecting on moments of national history, such as the 1947 Partition and its impact on Pakistani identity. <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At Howard, surrounded by a community that celebrated diverse voices and backgrounds, I began to see the importance of being authentic over trying to fit in. Kynard’s critique of the “white-policing function of language in the academy” reflected my own internalized struggles, where I had felt pressure to conform to Western ideals. Her story showed me that reclaiming my identity and embracing my heritage wasn’t just an option—it was necessary to fight back against the power structures that had oppressed us for so long. <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Just as Kynard empowered her students to express themselves authentically, my time at Howard helped me start to break free from the colonial mindset and embrace  who I truly am—without editing or sanitizing my culture to fit a foreign ideal.  <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is why I believe it’s crucial for Pakistani students to be more aware of their own cultural stories and traditions. Our schools need to prioritize introducing Pakistani literature alongside Western works. Doing so would not only give students a broader understanding of their own heritage, but also equip them to see the world through a lens that includes their identity. By elevating the voices of Pakistani writers, we can create a deeper sense of pride in our rich literary tradition and empower the next generation to recognize that their intelligence and self-worth come from embracing their own history, not from mimicking someone else's. <br> <br>
