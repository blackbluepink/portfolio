        <h1>Balli aur Mein: Humanizing Crime Through Pakistani Rap</h1>

        <p><b>Intro: </b>In Talha Anjum’s "Balli aur Mein," the story of a boy from Karachi’s slums reveals the harsh realities of poverty and crime, thus challenging societal perceptions of criminals. My essay talks about how systemic inequality drives desperate choices, therefore urging us to see the humanity behind those labeled as "dangerous."</p>

        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Talha Anjum's rap song "Balli aur Mein," the story of a young boy named Balli exposes the harsh realities of life in Karachi's slums. Balli, like many others in his situation, faces systemic poverty, lack of opportunities, and the pressure to support his family, eventually leading him down a path of crime. The song talks about the "انسانیت" (human side) of criminals, demonstrating that those often labeled as "ڈاکو" (dangerous and irredeemable) were once individuals like Balli—innocent, hopeful, and simply trying to survive. I argue that while criminals must face the consequences of their actions, they should also be humanized, given access to rehabilitation, and that systemic poverty—the root cause of much of Karachi’s street crime—must be addressed. Criminals deserve fair trials and a chance for redemption, rather than the brutal treatment they often face in Pakistan’s justice system.<br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Talha Anjum’s portrayal of Balli not only exposes the circumstances that drive individuals into crime but also challenges us to see the humanity in those often dismissed as criminals. His music is often raw and real and he raps about the harsh realities faced by those living in Karachi's streets, exploring themes of poverty, struggle, and survival. Talha Anjum explains in an interview, “The stories I tell are those that others are afraid to even talk about. I want to show that these so-called criminals were once just kids with dreams, until society gave them no other choice.” (Anjum) I’ve been listening to Talha Anjum since I was 14 and he is one of the most influential voices in my life. When “Balli aur mein” first came out, I remember listening to it with my friends and feeling this sense of empathy to criminals which I didn’t think I would ever feel. I think it is the way he tells the story, which unfortunately doesn't sound as good when translated to English - but I hope my rough translations can still give you a taste.            <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this context, the story of Balli serves as an analogy for the real struggles faced by those growing up in impoverished conditions in Pakistan. The lyrics describe Balli’s desperation as he fails to get a legitimate job, leading him to the dangerous decision of becoming a robber: "آ جا ماں تجھے میں شاپنگ کرواؤں، تُو فکر نہیں کر، پیسہ پانی ہے” (In English: Mother, I will take you shopping, don’t worry, money is flowing like water), which emphasizes how Balli’s initial motivation was to provide for his family. However, as Talha Anjum illustrates through his storytelling, Balli's desire for quick money via criminal means leads to his downfall. . The initial success of his criminal acts and Balli’s joy in being able to provide for his mother quickly turns into a tragic end. He spirals out of control, getting addicted to drugs, killing people and eventually being killed in a police encounter.            <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although Balli engages in illegal activities, the listener is invited to empathize with his situation. One critic noted that Anjum’s music “forces listeners to see Karachi’s street life not as a spectacle but as a social failure,”  (Big Scratch) underscoring how a lack of opportunity drives young men like Balli into desperation. This narrative challenges the common stereotype of criminals as inherently "bad" people, suggesting instead that their environment plays a significant role in shaping their actions. Talha Anjum raps, "ماں کا چہرہ آتا سامنے جب بھی اُس کی انگلی ٹرِگر پہ جائے" (His mother’s face appears in front of him whenever his finger touches the trigger), illustrating that Balli’s choices are haunted by the emotional weight of his familial responsibilities and that deep down, he has intense feelings of guilt.            <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Morgan Kelly, a distinguished economist and professor at University College Dublin, has extensively researched the relationship between economic factors and social issues. In his work Inequality and Crime, he notes that “inequality has (...) a strong and robust impact on violent crime.” He explains that strain and social disorganization theories provide frameworks to understand why individuals in lower socio-economic strata, like Balli, are more likely to engage in criminal activities​” (Kelly). “Strain theory,” in particular, argues that individuals in poverty are frustrated by their inability to achieve societal success, often resorting to crime out of “desperation”​ (Kelly). Balli’s story is a manifestation of this theory; his criminal actions are not driven by greed or malice but by a societal structure that offers him no other means of survival.            <br> <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Balli’s eventual fate, “آب بلی تو بچہ نہیں” (being killed in a police encounter) points to a broader issue in Pakistan’s justice system. Extra-judicial killings and brutal police practices are alarmingly common in the country. A recent Human Rights Watch report reveals that in 2023 alone, over 300 people were killed in police “encounters” in Karachi. Many are denied fair trials, their lives prematurely taken in a cycle of violence that denies justice to both the accused and their families. In a society that often sees criminals as disposable, "Balli aur Mein" is a powerful reminder that justice should not only punish but also provide the chance for redemption. The song reflects an urgent need to reevaluate Pakistan’s criminal justice system and to address the inequality that drives individuals toward crime. After all, if one song can shift our perspective on justice, perhaps society can also transform its approach to policing, focusing on rehabilitation rather than retribution. In this way, Anjum’s work continues to inspire a new generation to advocate for a more humane and equitable world.            <br> <br>
